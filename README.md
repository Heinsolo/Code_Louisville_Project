# Code_Louisville_Project

This is the README file for the Code Louisville Project for the May 2018 Class.

Although this project is very early in its stages, I hope it will become the website I need it to be for the class project requirements. I'm thinking a blog, but I'm working on trying to figure out how to update the blog without changing the HTML all the time. Maybe I'm overthinking it. Dunno. Will report back.
